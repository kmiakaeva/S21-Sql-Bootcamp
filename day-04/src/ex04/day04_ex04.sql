-- Write an SQL statement that satisfies the formula (R - S)âˆª(S - R) . Where R is the person_visits table with a filter
-- through January 2, 2022, S is also the person_visits table but with a different filter through January 6, 2022.
-- Please do your calculations with sets under the person_id column and this column will be alone in a result.
-- Please sort the result by the person_id column and present your final SQL in the v_symmetric_union (*) database view.

-- (*) To be honest, the definition of "symmetric union" doesn't exist in set theory. This is the author's interpretation,
-- the main idea is based on the existing rule of symmetric difference.
