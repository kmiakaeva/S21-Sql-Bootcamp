-- Letâ€™s create a Database Sequence named seq_person_discounts (starting with a value of 1) and set a default value for
-- the id attribute of the person_discounts table to automatically take a value from seq_person_discounts each time.
-- Please note that your next sequence number is 1, in this case please set an actual value for database sequence based on
-- formula "number of rows in person_discounts table" + 1. Otherwise you will get errors about Primary Key violation constraint.

CREATE SEQUENCE seq_person_discounts START 1;

SELECT SETVAL('seq_person_discounts', (SELECT MAX(id) + 1 FROM person_discounts));

ALTER TABLE person_discounts
